# HTMX TodoMVC

_[Big Sky Software](https://bigsky.software/) stack variant of Todo MVC_

A small proof of concept app using the stack built by corporate might of Big Sky software. Namely:

- [htmx](https://htmx.org/) - hypermedia based UI library ([in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/r-GSGH2RxJs))
- [hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/) - read-first client-side scripting language

Notable mention:

- [KitaJS Html](https://github.com/kitajs/html) - JSX runtime used for HTML templating (for that familiar feeling for react devs)

## Seeing is believing

Install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

Start it up

```
pnpm start
```

## Apology

If you don't like the look of indentation ðŸ™ˆ - let me say that it's the biome default in my defence.
